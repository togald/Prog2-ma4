MA4 1.2: Now, some hyperspheres! This is where math goes weird.
Hypersphere in 2 dimensions, n = 100000
Approximated volume: 3.14628
Exact volume       : 3.141592653589793
Hypersphere in 11 dimensions, n = 100000
Approximated volume: 1.88416
Exact volume       : 1.8841038793898994

MA4 1.3: Time for parallel programming, useful on hyperspheres!
--- Single-thread execution ---
Hypersphere in 11 dimensions, n = 10000000
Approximated volume: 1.8671616
Exact volume       : 1.8841038793898994
Execution time     : 88.25286898802733 seconds

--- 10-thread execution ---
Hypersphere in 11 dimensions, n = 10000000
Approximated volume: 1.8704383999999998
Exact volume       : 1.8841038793898994
Execution time     : 29.84732654999243 seconds

--- How many threads are sensible, really? ---
This system runs on 8 processor cores. Are more threads than cores beneficial?
